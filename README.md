National College of Ireland - Data Structure and Algorithms - Manage Your Music (CA1 - PartB)

Project Description:

Design and implement an application that makes use of the abstract datatypes you have learnt in class with interfaces and a swing GUI using NetBeans. Manage your music.

Design an application to allow a user to manage their music.

• They need to be able to create a playlist of liked songs. These songs will then be used to populate at least 2 playlists organised by criteria, such as genre.

• The user needs to be able to add a song from the liked playlist to one of the two genre playlists.

• The limitation of the system is that only the last song added to the liked playlist can be moved to the appropriate genre based playlist.

• Users can add, search, delete and move songs around on their playlists.

• The user needs to be able to see a printed list of whichever playlist they wish.

• Show how many songs are in each list.

• The user needs to be given the option to create a playlist that can be set to repeat.
